# A resource descriptor is a declarative configuration file that defines the semantic data,  
# states, and state transitions associated with a particular resource independent of protocol 
# media-type. Further, it also defines protocol specific templates for links that can be 
# and  included in the response and populated based on the associated state. By including  
# optional routes related metadata in the configuration, routes.rb mappings can be managed  
# DRYly in the resource descriptor file.
#
# The following sections facilitate a number of objectives including generating an ALPS profile 
# of the resource, generating human readable documents including sample representations, 
# decorating service responses, and scaffolding routes, controllers and models.

# This section associates a simple state-machine DSL with the particular resource. It shows
# the state name and lists the data and application affordances available in that state, 
# conditions for inclusion of a transition in a response and what states are exposed by 
# following the transitions.


# Semantic descriptors represent semantic definitions of data and thus in the context of ALPS 
# represent type='semantic' descriptors. Elements MAY include a sample value that can be used 
# to generate sample representations of the a resource in different media-types.
#
# Transition descriptors represent application affordances and in the context of ALPS 
# represent type='safe,unsafe,idempotent' descriptors.
